    "ABOUT_SITE_DESCRIPTION": "The \"Taheret HaBayit\" website and the \"Tahara Purification\" application are designed to help the woman cleanse the family and replace the manual purification tablets with new tools in the modern era. Many women testify that they are missing out on tests during the seven days, and that they are confused with calculating retirement days. The perfect solution is the \"purity of the home - purity\" program. The software gives the possibility of defining each woman as such, and according to what custom of laws she chooses. For example, according to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef zt \"l, according to Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu zt\" l or according to the testimony of Ashkenaz. The software is connected to a world clock by calculating the times and sending reminders in the morning and before sunset all over the world according to the woman's location online. In the app and on the site are Halachot in easy and shortened language according to topics, as well as a personal access code.",
